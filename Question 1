1. What are some examples of fungible tokens compared to non-fungible tokens that you use that are not blockchain related (Tutorial 9)?


Fungible and non-fungible tokens exist in everyday life, not just in blockchain.

Examples of Fungible Tokens:

Money: A $10 bill is the same as any other $10 bill—you can trade them without worrying about any difference.
Gift Cards: A $50 gift card to a store is the same as any other $50 gift card to that store.
Standard Movie Tickets: Tickets for the same show and time are interchangeable because they all give the same experience.

Simple Examples of Non-Fungible Tokens:

Concert Tickets: A front-row ticket is not the same as a seat in the back—they’re unique in value and experience.
Airline Tickets: Even if it’s the same flight, tickets differ by seat, class, or other features, so they’re not interchangeable.
Artwork: A painting is one of a kind, and even if part of a series, each piece is unique.
Fungible means replaceable and equal, while non-fungible means unique and different!
